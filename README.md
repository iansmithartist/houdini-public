# Hello! 👋

I'm CG Sup and freelance artist with 10+ years making immersive stuffs. Making cool things with Houdini and Unreal Engine 5. I'm the Project Lead on [Project Pegasus](https://www.sidefx.com/pegasus/) with SideFX and CG Sup at [NSC Creative](https://nsccreative.com/).

## Houdini
I'm sharing Houdini tips and tricks on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@iansmithartist) ▶, and you can download example files from my public [Houdini repository](https://github.com/iansmithartist/houdini-public)⭐.

If you find the content useful, you can support me on Ko-fi ☕.  Tips go towards the costs of GitHub.
